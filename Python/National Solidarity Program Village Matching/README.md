At the Dartmouth Political Violence FieldLab, I assisted on an impact evaluation of the World Bank National Solidarity Programme (NSP) in Afghanistan that funded villages to improve local democratic institutions and provision of basic services. In such an evaluation, it is necessary to control for various village characteristics, such as population and terrain. Since the raw NSP dataset did not report them, the Professor asked the lab to merge the NSP dataset with a USAID dataset on Afghan villages. 

A huge bottleneck was that the World Bank and USAID did not use the same English transliteration of Afghan village names. In addition, the World Bank would often separate a village into finer units like “upper-” and “lower-”. On top of that, both datasets contained over 40,000 data points, which made it impossible to perform manual matches. My partner and I created a string similarity program in Python that looped through NSP and USAID datasets to find matches using the Levenshtein distance between village names. We defined a match to have an 85% ratio. For NSP villages with no matches, the code produced a file containing a list of potential USAID village matches to make manual matching possible.

This folder contains the Levenshtein Distance code I collaborated with a fellow RA.
