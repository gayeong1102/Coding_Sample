This folder contains two Stata code samples.

1) Song_Gayeong_SW_1.do: 

This program replicates the empirical analysis of my paper studying the relationship between Taliban violence and infant immunization at week 0 and week 6 after birth in Afghanistan using DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) and GTD (Global Terrorism Database).

This code sample demonstrates:
  * My ability to produce replication code
  * My ability perform all aspects of a research project


2) Song_Gayeong_SW_2.do:

I created this program as part of my internship at the American Enterprise Institute. My PI, Dr. Eberstadt, was interested in understanding which model and which covariate displayed the strongest the strongest correlation with gdp. 

This code sample demonstates:
  * my coding style in Stata
  * my problem-solving ability (I discovered tempfile and tuples while doing this task)
